>parents feel bad so they get me a dog 
>A Karelian bear dog named Oreo
>Fucking best dog ever, goodest of the good boys
>We'd both go exploring the woods bordering my family's farmhouse
>miles upon miles of PNW forest with abandoned rail lines and old logging roads

>it's June and I'm planning on spending the summer following an old rail line I found
>it runs parallel to a small stream that went out to the coast 
>lots of interesting stuff, bridges that seem older than the trees, small hunting cabins, and once a old mineshaft
>tried to go in but Oreo wouldn't follow
>spent about twenty minutes trying to get my dog to follow but he just dragged his feet and barked a bunch
>only ever got him about ten feet into the mine before he ran back out
>eventually quit
>good idea looking back, I don't think I had a flashlight or anything on me
>decided to head back home following the rail line
>on the way back Oreo wouldn't stop looking behind us and barking
>there's mountain lions in Oregon so I don't fuck around with going back to check on what he's barking at
>Hightail it back home while the sun was setting
>don't want to get caught out after dark with any apex predators on the prowl
>finally make it home in time for dinner and Oreo calmed down
>I don't know what I ate for lunch yesterday but I still know that my dad made salisbury steak for dinner that night
>I miss my dad's cooking now
