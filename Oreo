>Be me 
>probably 14 years old ATT
>parents bought an few acres of land out near the Oregon coast
>about halfway between Cannon Beach and Portland if you know the area 
>moved there from Portland so I'm sulking that there's shit internet and no friends
>parents feel bad so they get me a dog 
>A Karelian bear dog named Oreo
>Fucking best dog ever, goodest of the good boys
>We'd both go exploring the woods bordering my family's farmhouse
>miles upon miles of PNW forest with abandoned rail lines and old logging roads
>we'd go after breakfast with a sandwich in my bag and come back when the sun was going down and my parents had dinner made
>During the winter I'd go out when school got out
>Made a few friends but never went out of my way to talk to people
>spend all of my free time out in the woods
>repeat for all of school year
>it's June and I'm planning on spending the summer following an old rail line I found
>it runs parallel to a small stream that went out to the coast 
>lots of interesting stuff, bridges that seem older than the trees, small hunting cabins, and once a old mineshaft
>tried to go in but Oreo wouldn't follow
>spent about twenty minutes trying to get my dog to follow but he just dragged his feet and barked a bunch
>only ever got him about ten feet into the mine before he ran back out
>eventually quit
>good idea looking back, I don't think I had a flashlight or anything on me
>decided to head back home following the rail line
>on the way back Oreo wouldn't stop looking behind us and barking
>there's mountain lions in Oregon so I don't fuck around with going back to check on what he's barking at
>Hightail it back home while the sun was setting
>don't want to get caught out after dark with any apex predators on the prowl
>finally make it home in time for dinner and Oreo calmed down
>I don't know what I ate for lunch yesterday but I still know that my dad made salisbury steak for dinner that night
>I miss my dad's cooking now


>That night trying to sleep after playing vidya games 
>RE 4 classic
>The dog maze scared the crap out of me 
>Oreo's sleeping on his mat next to the door in my room
>love the mutt but I'd blast him into a fine mist if he ever sprouted tentacles
>probably 2 am when I hear some branches rake against the window in my room
>The window is on the same wall as my bed so I don't see the branches
>freaked out because I used to be a wimp
>force myself to not think about a bloodthirsty spanish peasant trying to turn me and my family into fertilizer 
>reason that the window is twenty feet off the ground so I'm safe
>hear the raking again, freaked out more
>Oreo woke up
>he starts sniffing the air before growling
>I'm in the corner on my bed shitting bricks
>Reach for my pocket knife
>tfw I don't have a broken butterfly to protect myself
>I'm shivering in fear
>too scared to yell 
>Oreo's barking fully now
>the raking turns to pounding on the window
>it stops for a second
>Oreo shuts up
>I'm still frozen
>A loud THUD on the wall between me and the window
>The thing outside is coming steadily closer 
>THUD
>THUD
>THUD
>Now its on the other side of the wall from me 
>Oreo is going apeshit
>he jumps up on the bed scratching the wall where the thuds are coming from
>I'm right next to him 
>so scared that I'm convulsing
>the thuds get louder 
>THWACK
>it sounds like an entire cow is being slammed into the side of the house
>suddenly the light in my room turns on
>momentarily blinded
>I scream
>my parents come in 
>my dad has a baseball bat and my mom has a shotgun
>ask me wtf is going on
>I say theres something outside
>Oreo is still barking 
>The thuds stopped when my parents came in
>they think I had a nightmare and spooked Oreo, I'm sure that I didn't
>they go back to bed
>I see the sun rise before I drift off
